# Webhook Consolidation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Webhook Code
1. **`services/webhook_sync_service.py`** (511 lines)
   - Old comprehensive implementation
   - Uses MediaAttachment model (doesn't exist in current schema)
   - Complex conversation creation logic
   - AI processing hooks
   
2. **`services/openphone_webhook_service.py`** (360 lines) âœ…
   - New streamlined implementation
   - Matches current database schema
   - NOW supports media attachments!
   - Simpler, cleaner architecture

3. **`routes/api_routes.py`**
   - Has `/api/webhooks/openphone` endpoint
   - Uses new `OpenPhoneWebhookService`
   - HMAC signature verification

4. **`manage_webhooks.py`**
   - Webhook management utility
   - Can list, create, test, delete webhooks

## Consolidation Steps

### Phase 1: Clean Up (Ready to Execute)
- [ ] Delete `services/webhook_sync_service.py` (superseded)
- [ ] Remove webhook code from `services/message_service.py`
- [ ] Update any imports/references

### Phase 2: Enhance Current Implementation âœ…
- [x] Add media support to webhook handler
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite
- [x] Document all webhook payloads
- [ ] Test with real OpenPhone webhooks

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
- [ ] Configure webhook signing key in production
- [ ] Set webhook URL in environment
- [ ] Run `python manage_webhooks.py create`
- [ ] Monitor webhook processing

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Media Support** ðŸŽ‰
   - Message webhooks now capture `media` array
   - Media URLs stored in `activity.media_urls`
   - UI already supports displaying media

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - `webhook_payload_examples.py` - All event type examples
   - `test_webhook_handler.py` - Automated testing suite
   - Tests for media, AI content, all event types

3. **Documentation**
   - `WEBHOOK_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete integration guide
   - Payload structures for all events
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Remove old webhook service
   rm services/webhook_sync_service.py
   
   # Test everything still works
   python test_webhook_handler.py full
   ```

2. **Production Setup**
   ```bash
   # Configure webhooks
   python manage_webhooks.py create
   
   # Verify they're active
   python manage_webhooks.py list
   ```

3. **Monitor & Validate**
   - Watch logs for webhook events
   - Verify media attachments appear
   - Check AI summaries/transcripts populate

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Simpler Code** - 150 lines less, easier to maintain
2. **Media Support** - Finally captures image/file attachments!
3. **Better Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage
4. **Current Schema** - Matches actual database models
5. **Cleaner Separation** - Each webhook type has dedicated handler

## Risk Mitigation

- All webhooks are idempotent (safe to replay)
- Old events won't break new handler
- Extensive logging for debugging
- Test suite validates all scenarios

Ready to proceed with consolidation!
