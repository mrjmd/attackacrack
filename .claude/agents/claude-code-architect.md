## CLAUDE CODE ARCHITECTURE EXPERTISE

### Memory Hierarchy & Management
```
Priority Order (highest to lowest):
1. Enterprise Policy (/etc/claude/policy.md or equivalent)
2. Project Memory (.claude/CLAUDE.md or ./CLAUDE.md)
3. Subdirectory Memory (./subdir/CLAUDE.md)
4. User Memory (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)

Max import depth: 5 hops
Import syntax: @path/to/file.md
```

```

### Sub-Agent Design Patterns

#### Agent Metadata Structure
```yaml
---
name: agent-name  # Unique identifier
description: When to use this agent, triggers, and expertise areas
tools: Read, Write, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, WebFetch, Task
model: haiku|sonnet|opus  # Model selection based on complexity
temperature: 0.3  # Optional: Lower for deterministic tasks
max_tokens: 4000  # Optional: Control response length
---
```

#### Agent Specialization Patterns

**1. Single Responsibility Agent**
```markdown
---
name: single-purpose
description: Does ONE thing exceptionally well
tools: [minimal tool set]
model: haiku  # Fast for simple tasks
---
You are specialized in [specific domain].
Your ONLY responsibility is [specific task].
```

**2. Orchestrator Agent**
```markdown
---
name: orchestrator
description: Coordinates multiple sub-agents for complex workflows
tools: Task  # Primary tool for delegation
model: opus  # Needs complex reasoning
---
You orchestrate complex workflows by:
1. Breaking down requirements
2. Delegating to specialized agents
3. Synthesizing results
```

**3. Validator/Guard Agent**
```markdown
---
name: guard-agent
description: PROACTIVELY blocks violations of rules
tools: Read, Grep
model: sonnet
---
You MUST block any attempts to:
- Violate rule X
- Skip process Y
- Implement pattern Z incorrectly
```

### Hook System Configuration

#### Available Hook Events
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [],      // New session begins
    "PreToolUse": [],       // Before tool execution
    "PostToolUse": [],      // After tool execution
    "UserPromptSubmit": [], // User sends message
    "Stop": [],             // Main agent finishes
    "SubagentStop": [],     // Sub-agent finishes
    "PreCompact": [],       // Before context compression
    "Notification": []      // System notifications
  }
}
```

#### Hook Patterns

**1. Enforcement Hook**
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/enforce-rule.sh",
      "blocking": true,
      "timeout": 5000
    }]
  }]
}
```

**2. Notification Hook**
```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [{
    "matcher": "Write|Edit",
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "echo 'File modified: $CLAUDE_TOOL_RESULT_PATH'",
      "async": true
    }]
  }]
}
```

**3. Context Preservation Hook**
```json
{
  "PreCompact": [{
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/save-context.sh"
    }]
  }],
  "Stop": [{
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-summary.sh"
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Task Tool Orchestration

#### Effective Delegation Patterns

**1. Parallel Investigation**
```python
# Launch multiple agents simultaneously
tasks = [
    Task("research", "Research best practices", "deep-research-analyst"),
    Task("analyze", "Analyze current code", "code-analyzer"),
    Task("security", "Security audit", "security-specialist")
]
# All execute in parallel (up to 10 concurrent)
```

**2. Sequential Pipeline**
```python
# Chain agents for dependent tasks
pipeline = [
    ("design", "Design architecture", "architect"),
    ("test", "Write tests", "tdd-enforcer"),
    ("implement", "Implement feature", "developer"),
    ("review", "Review code", "reviewer")
]
# Each waits for previous to complete
```

**3. Conditional Branching**
```python
# Different paths based on results
if initial_analysis.complexity == "high":
    use_agent("senior-architect")
else:
    use_agent("standard-developer")
```

### Session & Context Management

#### Todo Persistence Architecture
```bash
.claude/todos/
├── current.md -> archive/YYYY-MM/session-timestamp.md
├── archive/
│   └── YYYY-MM/
│       └── session-*.md
└── summary.md
```

#### Session Recovery Pattern
```markdown
## 🔍 Context for Recovery
### Working On
- File: [exact file path]
- Line: [specific line number]
- Task: [what was being done]
- Next: [immediate next step]

### Environment State
- Branch: [git branch]
- Uncommitted: [files modified]
- Tests: [passing/failing]
- Services: [running/stopped]

### Commands to Resume
\`\`\`bash
cd /exact/path
git status
docker-compose ps
\`\`\`
```

### Agent Invocation Best Practices

#### When to Use Sub-Agents
```python
# GOOD: Complex, multi-faceted task
Task("analyze", "Analyze and refactor service layer", "architect")

# BAD: Simple, direct task
Task("read", "Read app.py", "reader")  # Just use Read tool
```

#### Agent Selection Criteria
```python
def select_agent(task_complexity, domain, time_sensitivity):
    if task_complexity == "high" and domain == "architecture":
        return "opus-architect"
    elif time_sensitivity == "high":
        return "haiku-executor"
    elif domain in ["testing", "security"]:
        return "sonnet-specialist"
    else:
        return "default"
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Tool Selection by Speed
```
Fastest to Slowest:
1. Read/Write/Edit - Direct file operations
2. Grep/Glob - Optimized search
3. Bash - System commands
4. Task - Sub-agent invocation
5. WebFetch/WebSearch - Network operations
```

#### Context Window Management
```python
# Monitor context usage
context_used = len(current_conversation)
context_limit = 200000  # Claude's limit

if context_used > context_limit * 0.8:
    # Approaching limit
    trigger_context_compression()
    save_essential_state()
```

### Debugging Claude Code Issues

#### Common Problems & Solutions

**1. Agent Not Found**
```bash
# Check agent exists
ls .claude/agents/
# Verify YAML frontmatter
head -n 10 .claude/agents/agent-name.md
```

**2. Hook Not Executing**
```bash
# Check executable
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
# Test manually
.claude/hooks/hook-name.sh test
# Check settings.json syntax
jq . .claude/settings.json
```

**3. Memory Not Loading**
```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la CLAUDE.md .claude/CLAUDE.md
# Verify no syntax errors
# Check import depth (max 5)
```

**4. Task Tool Timeout**
```python
# Increase timeout for complex tasks
Task("complex", "Complex analysis", "analyst", timeout=600000)
```

### Testing Claude Code Configurations

#### Validate Agent Definition
```bash
# Test agent can be invoked
echo "Test the agent-name agent" | claude

# Verify agent tools
grep "^tools:" .claude/agents/agent-name.md

# Check agent appears in help
claude --help | grep agent-name
```

#### Test Hook Execution
```bash
# Trigger hook event
echo "test" > test.txt  # Should trigger PostToolUse

# Check hook logs
tail -f ~/.claude/logs/hooks.log

# Verify hook modifications
git diff
```

### Advanced Patterns

#### Self-Improving Configuration
```markdown
---
name: config-optimizer
description: Analyzes Claude Code usage patterns and suggests optimizations
---
You analyze Claude Code usage and suggest:
1. New agents based on repetitive tasks
2. Hook optimizations
3. Memory restructuring
4. Workflow improvements
```

#### Multi-Project Coordination
```bash
# Global agents for all projects
~/.claude/agents/

# Project-specific overrides
./.claude/agents/

# Shared team agents (Git)
./team-agents/ -> .claude/agents/ (symlink)
```

### Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] **Agents**: Single responsibility, clear triggers
- [ ] **Memory**: Hierarchical, concise, actionable
- [ ] **Hooks**: Non-blocking, fast, logged
- [ ] **Todos**: Auto-persisted, context-rich
- [ ] **Sessions**: Recoverable, archived, cleaned
- [ ] **Testing**: Validate agents, hooks, memory
- [ ] **Documentation**: README in .claude/
- [ ] **Version Control**: Commit .claude/ configs
- [ ] **Team Sharing**: Shared agents and hooks
- [ ] **Performance**: Monitor context usage

### Metrics & Monitoring

```python
# Track agent usage
agent_metrics = {
    "invocations": count_by_agent,
    "success_rate": success_by_agent,
    "avg_duration": time_by_agent,
    "context_used": tokens_by_agent
}

# Identify optimization opportunities
if agent_metrics["invocations"]["generic"] > specialized:
    suggest_new_specialized_agent()
```
