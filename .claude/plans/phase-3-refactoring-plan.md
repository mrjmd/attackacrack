# Phase 3 Service Refactoring Plan

## Overview
Total Violations: 447 across 11 services
Goal: Complete repository pattern implementation for all remaining services

## Refactoring Phases

### Week 1: High Priority Services (Total Violations: 65)
1. AuthService (28 violations)
   - TDD Test Coverage
   - AuthRepository Creation
   - Service Refactoring
   
2. InvoiceService (12 violations)
   - TDD Test Coverage
   - InvoiceRepository Creation
   - Service Refactoring

3. TodoService (25 violations)
   - TDD Test Coverage
   - TodoRepository Creation
   - Service Refactoring

### Week 2: Core Feature Services (Total Violations: 128)
1. MessageService (8 violations)
2. DashboardService (31 violations)
3. CampaignService (89 violations)
   - Comprehensive test suites
   - Repository implementations
   - Systematic refactoring

### Week 3: Complex Services (Total Violations: 84)
1. ConversationService (42 violations)
2. SMSMetricsService (34 violations)
3. OpenPhoneSyncService (8 violations)
   - Advanced repository patterns
   - Intricate test scenarios
   - Performance optimization

### Week 4+: Major Refactoring (Total Violations: 177)
1. QuickBooksSyncService (168 violations)
   - Most complex refactoring
   - Comprehensive test strategy
   - Potential architectural review

2. DiagnosticsService (9 violations)
   - Final service in refactoring sprint

## Refactoring Strategy
- Strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- 100% test coverage
- Zero direct database queries
- Update service registry
- Performance profiling after each refactoring

## Success Metrics
- ✅ All 447 database violations resolved
- ✅ 95%+ test coverage
- ✅ Zero direct database queries in services
- ✅ Standardized repository implementations
- ✅ Improved system maintainability

## Potential Risks
1. Complex service interdependencies
2. Performance impact during refactoring
3. Potential regression in existing functionality

## Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental refactoring
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Performance benchmarking
- Gradual rollout of changes

## Next Actions
1. Review current repository base classes
2. Update BaseRepository interface if needed
3. Prepare detailed test scenarios for each service
4. Set up continuous integration checks
