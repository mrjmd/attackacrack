## âœ… Phase 0: Valkey/Redis Connection Fix (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Restore Valkey database connection for Celery workers

### 0.1 Valkey Connection Issue - RESOLVED
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Reconnected Valkey database to DigitalOcean app
- [x] Verified Valkey database ID: 8f6abeee-fab4-471b-8f7d-66b16e2b6c3e
- [x] Updated worker environment variables with explicit Valkey URL
- [x] Fixed Redis URLs using doctl CLI (not UI required!)
- [x] Tested Celery worker connectivity - **CONNECTED**
- [x] SSL/TLS configuration working with CERT_NONE
- [x] Worker successfully connected: `celery@attackacrack-worker ready`

### Resolution Summary:
- Issue: Worker env vars with `type: SECRET` weren't being read
- Fix: Used doctl to update worker env vars with explicit values
- Result: Worker connected to Valkey at `rediss://db-valkey-nyc3-14182-do-user-24328167-0.f.db.ondigitalocean.com:25061`

## âœ… Phase 1: Emergency Security Response (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Rotate exposed credentials and secure the repository

### 1.1 Credential Rotation
**Status**: Not needed - `.env` was never in git history
- [x] Verified `.env` file was never committed to repository
- [x] Confirmed secrets were not exposed in git history
- [x] Decision made not to rotate credentials since they weren't exposed

### 1.2 Repository Security
- [x] Verified `.env` file is not in git history (using BFG scan)
- [x] Confirmed `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.example` already exists with placeholder values
- [x] Audited git history - no secrets found
- [x] GitHub secret scanning is available

---

## âœ… Phase 2: Environment Variable Management Fix (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Implement proper secret management without template substitution

### 2.1 GitHub Secrets Validation
**Status**: âœ… All required secrets exist in GitHub repository
- [x] Verified 23 secrets are configured in GitHub
- [x] Updated DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN with valid token
- [x] Documented all secrets in use
- [x] All secrets are actively used (none to remove)

### 2.2 DigitalOcean App Platform Configuration
- [x] Added all 23 secrets directly to DigitalOcean App Platform
  - [x] Used script to bulk add missing secrets from .env file
  - [x] Verified all secrets are now in DO (23 total)
  - [x] Deleted ephemeral script after use
- [x] Updated app.yaml to use native DO env var bindings (type: SECRET, no values)
- [x] Removed ALL `sed` substitutions from deployment workflow
- [x] Successfully tested deployment with native DO secret management
- [x] Verified secrets persist after deployment

### 2.3 Deployment Pipeline Updates
- [x] Simplified deployment workflow with hardcoded app ID
- [x] Removed fragile grep-based app discovery
- [x] Removed 20+ sed template substitutions
- [x] Deployment now preserves all existing secrets
- [x] Health check verification working

### 2.4 Local Development Environment
- [x] Updated docker-compose.yml to use port 5001 (port 5000 conflict)
- [x] Docker services running successfully
- [ ] Create development environment setup script
- [ ] Document required environment variables in README
- [ ] Add environment variable validation on app startup
- [ ] Create docker-compose.override.yml for local overrides

## âœ… Phase 3: Redis/Valkey Connection Fix (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Fix production Redis connectivity issues

### 3.1 Valkey Service Configuration - RESOLVED
**Final Status**: Valkey successfully connected and working

#### Completed:
- [x] Got Valkey connection string from DigitalOcean
- [x] Updated Redis URLs in DigitalOcean App Platform
- [x] Updated GitHub Secrets with Valkey URL
- [x] Updated local .env file with Valkey URL
- [x] Fixed worker env vars using doctl CLI with explicit values
- [x] Worker now connected to Valkey successfully

#### Resolution:
- Problem: Native DO env var management (type: SECRET without values) wasn't working for worker
- Solution: Used doctl to set explicit values for worker env vars
- Result: Worker connected and ready at `celery@attackacrack-worker`

### 3.2 Connection Testing - COMPLETED
- [x] Valkey connection verified in logs
- [x] Celery worker connectivity confirmed
- [x] Worker registered all tasks successfully
- [x] Connection string: `rediss://db-valkey-nyc3-14182-do-user-24328167-0.f.db.ondigitalocean.com:25061`
- [x] Background task processing restored
