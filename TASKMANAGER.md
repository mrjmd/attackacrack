**Goal**: Restore Valkey database connection for Celery workers

#### 0.1 Valkey Connection Issue

## âœ… Phase 1: Emergency Security Response (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Rotate exposed credentials and secure the repository

### 1.1 Credential Rotation
**Status**: Not needed - `.env` was never in git history
- [x] Verified `.env` file was never committed to repository
- [x] Confirmed secrets were not exposed in git history
- [x] Decision made not to rotate credentials since they weren't exposed

### 1.2 Repository Security
- [x] Verified `.env` file is not in git history (using BFG scan)
- [x] Confirmed `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [x] `.env.example` already exists with placeholder values
- [x] Audited git history - no secrets found
- [x] GitHub secret scanning is available

---

## âœ… Phase 2: Environment Variable Management Fix (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Implement proper secret management without template substitution

- [x] Updated DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN with valid token
- [x] Documented all secrets in use
- [x] All secrets are actively used (none to remove)

### 2.2 DigitalOcean App Platform Configuration
- [x] Added all 23 secrets directly to DigitalOcean App Platform
  - [x] Used script to bulk add missing secrets from .env file
  - [x] Verified all secrets are now in DO (23 total)
  - [x] Deleted ephemeral script after use
- [x] Updated app.yaml to use native DO env var bindings (type: SECRET, no values)
- [x] Removed ALL `sed` substitutions from deployment workflow
- [x] Successfully tested deployment with native DO secret management
- [x] Verified secrets persist after deployment

### 2.3 Deployment Pipeline Updates
- [x] Simplified deployment workflow with hardcoded app ID
- [x] Removed fragile grep-based app discovery
- [x] Removed 20+ sed template substitutions
- [x] Deployment now preserves all existing secrets
- [x] Health check verification working

### 2.4 Local Development Environment
- [x] Updated docker-compose.yml to use port 5001 (port 5000 conflict)
- [x] Docker services running successfully
- [ ] Create development environment setup script
- [ ] Document required environment variables in README
- [ ] Add environment variable validation on app startup
- [ ] Create docker-compose.override.yml for local overrides
