"""Integration Tests for Campaign Workflow

TDD RED PHASE: These integration tests define expected end-to-end campaign behavior.
All tests MUST fail initially to validate TDD workflow.

Test Coverage:
- Full campaign creation → send → track flow
- Campaign with A/B testing end-to-end
- Campaign with contact filters
- Campaign pause/resume workflow
- Integration with OpenPhone API
- Database transaction integrity
