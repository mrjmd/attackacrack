Celery Beat Schedule Configuration Tests - TDD Enforcement

These tests enforce that the Celery beat schedule is properly configured
with all required periodic tasks for campaign processing and maintenance.

TDD PHASES:
1. RED: These tests will FAIL initially because:
   - 'process-campaign-queue' task is missing from beat schedule
   - Only 'run-daily-tasks' is currently scheduled
   - Campaign queue processing is not automated

2. GREEN: Fix celery_worker.py to add the missing schedule entry
3. REFACTOR: Optimize schedule configuration and add monitoring

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Beat schedule MUST include 'process-campaign-queue' every 60 seconds
- Beat schedule MUST include existing 'run-daily-tasks' every 24 hours
- Task paths MUST be correct and importable
- Schedule intervals MUST be appropriate for production use
- Configuration MUST be testable and verifiable

# =============================================================================
# TDD ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY - Celery Beat Schedule Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# STATUS: RED PHASE COMPLETE ✅
# - 20 comprehensive tests written that enforce proper beat schedule configuration
# - Tests will fail because 'process-campaign-queue' is missing from beat schedule
# - Current schedule only has 'run-daily-tasks', missing campaign automation
# - All task path validation and import checks are in place
#
# EVIDENCE OF CURRENT BROKEN STATE:
# 1. Beat schedule missing 'process-campaign-queue' task
# 2. Campaign queue processing is not automated (manual only)
# 3. Only daily maintenance tasks are scheduled
# 4. Campaign task exists in tasks.campaign_tasks but is not scheduled
#
# IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR GREEN PHASE:
# 1. Add 'process-campaign-queue' to celery.conf.beat_schedule in celery_worker.py
# 2. Set correct task path: 'tasks.campaign_tasks.process_campaign_queue'
# 3. Set correct interval: 60.0 seconds (1 minute)
# 4. Maintain existing 'run-daily-tasks' configuration
# 5. Ensure timezone remains 'UTC'
#
# EXACT MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:
# Add this to celery_worker.py beat_schedule dictionary:
# ```python
# celery.conf.beat_schedule = {
#     'run-daily-tasks': {
#         'task': 'services.scheduler_service.run_daily_tasks',

#
# VERIFICATION AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
# Run: docker-compose exec web pytest tests/unit/test_celery_beat_schedule.py -v
# Expected Result: All 20 tests should pass
#
# CURRENT TEST RESULTS (RED PHASE):
# - 6 tests will fail (missing process-campaign-queue task)
# - 14 tests will pass (documenting current state and validating existing config)
#
# PRODUCTION IMPACT:
# - Campaign queue processing will be automated every 60 seconds
# - Manual campaign triggering will no longer be required
# - Near real-time SMS sending within daily limits (125 texts/day)
# - Improved campaign reliability and user experience
#
# This completes the TDD enforcement for beat schedule configuration.
