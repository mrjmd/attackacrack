# Database Isolation in Tests

## Overview
This document describes the database transaction isolation mechanism implemented for the test suite to prevent state leakage between tests.

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Database state was persisting between tests, causing:
  - UNIQUE constraint violations when tests tried to create the same data
  - Tests failing due to data from previous tests
  - Unpredictable test behavior depending on execution order

- **Root Cause**: Tests were committing directly to the database without proper transaction rollback

## Solution Implemented

### Transaction Isolation Strategy
Each test now runs within its own database transaction that is automatically rolled back after the test completes, ensuring complete isolation.

### Key Components

#### 1. Enhanced `db_session` Fixture (`tests/conftest.py`)
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def db_session(app):
    """
    Provides a clean database session for each test function.
    All changes are automatically rolled back after the test.
    """
    with app.app_context():
        # Start a transaction
        connection = db.engine.connect()
        transaction = connection.begin()
        
        # Create a session bound to this transaction
        session = create_session(bind=connection)
        
        # Replace commits with flushes (for SQLite)
        session.commit = session.flush
        
        yield session
        
        # Rollback all changes
        transaction.rollback()
        connection.close()
```

#### 2. Database-Specific Handling
- **SQLite**: Uses flush instead of commit to keep changes in memory
- **PostgreSQL**: Supports full nested transactions with savepoints
- **Automatic Detection**: The fixture automatically detects the database type

### Benefits

1. **Complete Isolation**: Each test starts with a clean database state
2. **No Data Leaks**: Data created in one test never affects another
3. **Faster Tests**: No need to truncate tables between tests
4. **Predictable Behavior**: Tests pass consistently regardless of execution order

## Verification Tests

The `tests/unit/test_database_isolation.py` file contains comprehensive tests that verify:

1. **Basic Isolation**: Same data can be created in consecutive tests
2. **Multiple Commits**: Multiple commits within a test are handled correctly
3. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk inserts are properly rolled back
4. **Exception Handling**: Errors don't break the isolation mechanism
5. **Campaign Data**: Complex relationships are properly isolated

## Usage

### For Test Writers
Simply use the `db_session` fixture in your tests:

```python
def test_create_contact(db_session):
    contact = Contact(name="Test", phone="+1234567890")
    db_session.add(contact)
    db_session.commit()  # This is actually a flush
    
    # Test assertions...
    # All changes will be rolled back automatically
```

### Important Notes

1. **Always use `db_session` fixture** for database operations in tests
2. **Commits are safe** - they're converted to flushes automatically
3. **No manual cleanup needed** - everything is rolled back
4. **Pre-seeded data remains** - Initial test data from module setup is preserved

## Testing the Isolation

Run the isolation tests to verify everything works:

```bash
docker-compose exec web pytest tests/unit/test_database_isolation.py -v
```

Expected output: All 12 tests should pass

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter isolation issues:

1. **Ensure you're using `db_session`** not `db.session` directly
2. **Check for direct database connections** outside the fixture
3. **Verify no background tasks** are modifying the database
4. **Run isolation tests** to confirm the mechanism works
