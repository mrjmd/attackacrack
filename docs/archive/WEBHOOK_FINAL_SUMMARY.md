# OpenPhone Webhook Integration - Final Summary

## Actual Webhook Types Available (Per API Documentation)

Based on the official OpenPhone API documentation and web UI, these are the **only 6 webhook event types** available:

1. **`message.received`** - Incoming message received
2. **`message.delivered`** - Outgoing message delivered
3. **`call.completed`** - Call finished (any status)
4. **`call.recording.completed`** - Call recording is ready
5. **`call.summary.completed`** - AI call summary generated
6. **`call.transcript.completed`** - AI call transcript generated

## What We Initially Thought vs Reality

### ‚ùå Webhook Types That DON'T Exist:
- `message.sent` - Not available
- `message.failed` - Not available
- `call.started` - Not available
- `call.missed` - Not available
- `call.answered` - Not available
- `call.forwarded` - Not available
- `call_summary.created/updated` - Actually `call.summary.completed`
- `call_transcript.created/updated` - Actually `call.transcript.completed`
- `token.validated` - Not needed

### ‚úÖ What Actually Exists:
- Only 6 webhook types total
- Simpler naming convention (all use `.completed` suffix)
- No intermediate states (no `.started`, `.updated`, etc.)

## Key Features That ARE Available

### 1. Media Attachments in Messages üìé
```json
{
  "type": "message.received",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "media": [
        "https://media.openphone.com/attachment1.jpg",
        "https://media.openphone.com/attachment2.pdf"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Call Recording URLs üéôÔ∏è
- Provided in `call.completed` if available immediately
- Updated via `call.recording.completed` when ready later

### 3. AI-Generated Content ü§ñ
- Call summaries with key points and next steps
- Full transcripts with speaker identification

## Simplified Webhook Creation

Now we create just ONE webhook subscription with all 6 events:

```bash
python manage_webhooks.py create
```

This creates:
```json
{
  "url": "https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/openphone",
  "events": [
    "message.received",
    "message.delivered",
    "call.completed",
    "call.recording.completed",
    "call.summary.completed",
    "call.transcript.completed"
  ]
}
```

## Updated Implementation

Our webhook service now:
1. ‚úÖ Handles exactly these 6 event types
2. ‚úÖ Captures media attachments from messages
3. ‚úÖ Updates calls with recordings when ready
4. ‚úÖ Stores AI summaries and transcripts
5. ‚úÖ Uses correct event names (`.completed` suffix)

## Testing

```bash
# Test all 6 webhook types
python test_webhook_handler.py all

# Specific feature tests
python test_webhook_handler.py media
python test_webhook_handler.py ai
```

## Benefits of Simplified Architecture

1. **Fewer Events** = Simpler code, easier to maintain
2. **Consistent Naming** = All completion events use `.completed`
3. **No State Tracking** = No need to track intermediate states
4. **Complete Data** = Events fire when data is ready

## Important Notes

- We don't get notified when messages are sent (only when delivered)
- We don't get call start events (only completion)
- Failed messages don't trigger webhooks
- All AI content uses `.completed` (not `.created`/`.updated`)
