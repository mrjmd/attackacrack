# The Environment Variables Saga: A Complete History

## Executive Summary

Over the course of several weeks, we've battled with environment variables being cleared on every deployment to DigitalOcean App Platform. This document chronicles every attempt, failure, and lesson learned from exhaustive Git history analysis.

**Current Status**: RESOLVED (August 16, 2025) - Using encrypted values (EV[1:...]) directly in app.yaml that are safe to commit to Git.

**Total Attempts Documented**: 10+ different approaches over 20+ commits

## Complete Timeline with Git Evidence

### July 31 - August 1, 2025 - Initial Production Setup
- **Commits**: `490b3b3` (secrets cleanup), `533b87a` (refactoring for SSL, secret management)
- Multiple attempts to get basic deployment working
- Environment variables initially in plain text (security risk)
- Discovered we couldn't commit secrets to Git
- First attempt at `type: SECRET` without values (failed)

### August 2, 2025 - The GitHub Secrets & Component Update Attempt
- **11:32 AM**: Commit `b662b83` "moving env secrets to github"
  - Added `${SECRET_KEY}` placeholders to app.yaml with `type: SECRET`
  - Created `.github/scripts/update-image-only.sh` attempting to use non-existent `doctl apps update-component` command
  - Script tried to update only images without touching env vars:
    ```bash
    doctl apps update-component $APP_ID \
        --component-name attackacrack-web \
        --spec-type service \
        --image-tag $NEW_TAG
    ```
  - **FAILED**: Command doesn't exist in doctl
  - Also used wrong GitHub action (`action-doctl` not `app_action`)
  - Result: App got literal "${SECRET_KEY}" strings

### August 2-3, 2025 - More Failed Attempts
- **Commits**: `e2656c4` "switching back to using repo level secrets", `69e089f` "fixing variable push?"
- Attempted multiple variations of GitHub secrets with placeholders
- Removed `type: SECRET` hoping that would help
- Still getting literal `${VARIABLE}` strings in deployed app

### August 15, 2025 - The Great Unraveling
- **Commit `1a15a11`**: "Fix Flask-Session Redis connection issue"
  - Discovered Flask-Session wasn't working with multiple workers
  - Only 1 in 4 requests authenticated successfully
- **6:28 PM - Commit `0354f95`**: "Remove encryption from all environment variables"
  - Removed `type: SECRET` from all variables
  - Still had no values in app.yaml
  - Variables were being cleared on every deploy

### August 16, 2025 - The Multiple Deployment Strategy Era
- **Commit `6a552b2`**: "Fix deployment: Use native DigitalOcean env var management"
  - Attempted to remove env vars from app.yaml entirely
  - Planned to manage through DO dashboard only
  - **FAILED**: Deployment still cleared vars not in spec
- **Commit `602424f`**: "Fix environment variables being cleared on deployment"
  - Created `scripts/fix_env_vars.sh` manual recovery script
  - Python script reads .env, fetches current spec, updates values, redeploys
  - **WORKS** but requires manual intervention after every deploy
- **Commit `9f41b83`**: "Fix deployment workflow to preserve environment variables"
  - Modified deploy.yml to fetch current spec before updating:
    ```yaml
    doctl apps spec get ${{ env.APP_ID }} > .do/app-deploy.yaml
    sed -i "s/tag: .*/tag: ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}/g" .do/app-deploy.yaml
    doctl apps update ${{ env.APP_ID }} --spec .do/app-deploy.yaml
    ```
  - **FAILED**: Circular dependency - if previous deploy cleared vars, fetched spec has empty vars
- **Commit `2eb38bb`**: "Implement proper environment variable solution using official DigitalOcean GitHub Action"
  - Switched from `digitalocean/action-doctl@v2` to `digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2`
  - Added all 19 secrets as environment variables in GitHub Action
  - Updated app.yaml with `${VARIABLE}` placeholders and `type: SECRET`
  - **FAILED**: Despite using official action, substitution didn't occur
  - Worker still trying to connect to default `redis://redis:6379/0`

### August 16, 2025 - The Breakthrough
- **Commit `ca4d324`**: "SOLVED: Environment variables saga - Using encrypted values in app.yaml"
  - After running manual fix script, exported spec with `doctl apps spec get`
  - Discovered DigitalOcean had automatically encrypted all sensitive values
  - Values appeared as `EV[1:key:encrypted_base64]` format
  - These encrypted values are **safe to commit to Git**
  - Updated app.yaml with all 19+ encrypted values for both web and worker services
  - Simplified deploy.yml to just: `doctl apps update $APP_ID --spec .do/app.yaml --wait`
  - **SUCCESS**: Environment variables finally persist across deployments!

## Complete List of Attempts (From Git History)

### Attempt 1: Plain Environment Variables in app.yaml
**Commits**: Initial setup (pre-July 31)
**Approach**: Declare environment variables with values directly in app.yaml
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Security risk, secrets exposed in Git
**Lesson**: Never commit secrets to version control

### Attempt 2: Environment Variables with type: SECRET (no values)
**Commit**: `490b3b3` (July 31, 2025)
**Approach**: Mark environment variables as `type: SECRET` in app.yaml without values
**Problem**: No values were provided, just the key and type
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - App couldn't read empty encrypted variables
**Lesson**: SECRET type requires actual values to encrypt

### Attempt 3: Component-Level Update Script (Previously Undocumented)
**Commit**: `b662b83` (August 2, 2025)
**Approach**: Created `.github/scripts/update-image-only.sh` to update only Docker images
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Attempted to use non-existent doctl command
doctl apps update-component $APP_ID \
    --component-name attackacrack-web \
    --spec-type service \
    --image-tag $NEW_TAG
```
**Problem**: The `doctl apps update-component` command doesn't exist
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Command not found
**Lesson**: doctl doesn't support component-level updates, only full spec updates

### Attempt 4: GitHub Repository Secrets with Placeholders
**Commits**: 
- `b662b83` "moving env secrets to github" 
- `e2656c4` "switching back to using repo level secrets"
- `69e089f` "fixing variable push?"
**Approach**: 
1. Added placeholders in app.yaml: `value: ${SECRET_KEY}`
2. Initially marked them as `type: SECRET`
3. Stored actual values in GitHub repository secrets
4. Expected GitHub/DO to substitute values during deployment
**What Actually Happened**:
```yaml
# In deploy.yml, we used:
- uses: digitalocean/action-doctl@v2  # ← This ONLY installs CLI
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

# Then ran:
- run: doctl apps update $APP_ID --spec .do/app-deploy.yaml

# Result: App literally received "${SECRET_KEY}" as the value!
```
**Problem**: The placeholders `${SECRET_KEY}` were NOT being substituted!
- We used `digitalocean/action-doctl` which only installs the CLI tool
- We needed `digitalocean/app_action` which has substitution engine
- The literal string `${SECRET_KEY}` was being deployed as the env var value
- App tried to connect to Redis using the string "${REDIS_URL}"
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - App got literal `${SECRET_KEY}` instead of actual values
**Critical Lesson**: We were using the WRONG GitHub Action!

### Attempt 5: Remove Encryption, Use Plain Text
**Commit**: `0354f95` (August 15, 2025)
**Approach**: Remove `type: SECRET` from all env vars
**Problem**: Still no values in app.yaml
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Variables declared without values = cleared on deploy
**Lesson**: Declaring env vars without values tells DO to set them to empty

### Attempt 6: Native DigitalOcean Management
**Commit**: `6a552b2` (August 16, 2025)
**Approach**: Remove env vars from app.yaml entirely, manage through DO dashboard
**Problem**: GitHub Actions deployment uses app.yaml which has no env vars
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Deployment clears all env vars not in spec
**Lesson**: `doctl apps update --spec` replaces ENTIRE spec

### Attempt 7: Manual Fix Script
**Commit**: `602424f` (August 16, 2025)
**Approach**: Created `scripts/fix_env_vars.sh` to restore env vars after deploy
- Python script reads .env file
- Fetches current spec from DO
- Updates all env var values
- Redeploys with complete spec
**Result**: ✅ WORKS but requires manual intervention
**Lesson**: Proved the concept but not sustainable for CI/CD

### Attempt 8: Fetch Current Spec in GitHub Actions (sed for image only)
**Commit**: `9f41b83` (August 16, 2025)
**Approach**: Modify deploy.yml to fetch current spec before updating
```yaml
doctl apps spec get ${{ env.APP_ID }} > .do/app-deploy.yaml
sed -i "s/tag: .*/tag: ${{ steps.image-tag.outputs.tag }}/g" .do/app-deploy.yaml
doctl apps update ${{ env.APP_ID }} --spec .do/app-deploy.yaml
```
**Problem**: If previous deployment already cleared env vars, fetching spec gets empty vars
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Circular dependency problem
**Note**: Contrary to initial claims, we DID use sed substitution here (for image tags)

### Attempt 9: Official DigitalOcean GitHub Action
**Commit**: `2eb38bb` (August 16, 2025)
**Approach**: Use the official `digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2`
1. All 19 secrets added to GitHub repository settings
2. Updated app.yaml with `${SECRET_KEY}` placeholders
3. Marked all as `type: SECRET`
4. Used official action instead of action-doctl
**What Actually Happened**:
- GitHub Actions showed env vars being passed: `SECRET_KEY: ***`, `REDIS_URL: ***`
- Action said "app 'attackacrack-prod' already exists, updating..."
- Deployment completed successfully in 56 seconds
- BUT: Deployed spec only had 8 env vars (4 static ones × 2 services)
- All `${VARIABLE}` placeholders were NOT substituted
- App still trying to connect to default `redis://redis:6379/0`
**Problem**: The official action didn't perform substitution as documented
**Result**: ❌ FAILED - Substitution didn't happen despite using official action

### Attempt 10: The Final Solution - Encrypted Values
**Commit**: `ca4d324` (August 16, 2025, 2:30 PM)
**Approach**: Use DigitalOcean's encrypted value feature
1. Run manual fix script once to set all env vars
2. Export spec with `doctl apps spec get` 
3. DO automatically encrypts sensitive values as `EV[1:key:encrypted]`
4. Commit these encrypted values to Git (they're safe!)
5. Deploy with simple `doctl apps update --spec app.yaml`
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - Environment variables finally persist!
**Why it works**: Encrypted values are app-specific and safe in version control

## Root Cause Analysis

### The REAL Problem We Missed

**We've been using the WRONG GitHub Action all along!**

- **What we used**: `digitalocean/action-doctl@v2` - Just installs the doctl CLI
- **What we needed**: `digitalocean/app_action@v2` - Actually handles env var substitution

The `${VARIABLE_NAME}` placeholders we tried ONLY work with the official app deployment action, NOT with plain `doctl` commands!

### The Fundamental Problem

DigitalOcean's `doctl apps update --spec` command **replaces the entire app specification** AND doesn't do any variable substitution. It takes the spec file literally, including any `${PLACEHOLDER}` strings.

### The Circular Dependency

1. Deployment A runs with incomplete spec → clears env vars
2. We manually fix env vars using our script
3. Deployment B fetches "current" spec to preserve env vars
4. But if Deployment A already ran, the "current" spec has no env vars
5. Deployment B deploys empty env vars
6. Cycle repeats

### Why DigitalOcean Does This

- **Security**: Prevents accidental exposure of secrets in specs
- **Determinism**: Spec file is the single source of truth
- **Auditability**: Every deployment has a complete spec

## Available Solutions

### Solution 1: Official DigitalOcean GitHub Action (RECOMMENDED)
Use `digitalocean/app_action` which supports env var substitution:

```yaml
- name: Deploy the app
  uses: digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2
  env:
    SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY }}
    REDIS_URL: ${{ secrets.REDIS_URL }}
    # ... all other secrets
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    app_name: attackacrack-prod
```

**Pros**: 
- Built-in env var substitution
- Officially supported
- Handles encryption automatically

**Cons**: 
- Need to migrate all secrets to GitHub
- Different from current workflow

### Solution 2: Encrypted Values in app.yaml
1. Set all env vars with values in DO dashboard
2. Mark them as type: SECRET
3. Export the spec (values will be encrypted)
4. Store encrypted values in app.yaml
5. Deploy with encrypted spec

```yaml
envs:
  - key: SECRET_KEY
    type: SECRET
    value: EV[1:encryptedValueHere:base64data]  # Safe to commit
    scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
```

**Pros**: 
- Secrets are encrypted, safe in Git
- Single source of truth
- Works with current workflow

**Cons**: 
- Encrypted values are app-specific
- Need to re-encrypt if app is recreated

### Solution 3: Two-Stage Deployment
1. Deploy app structure (without env vars)
2. Use separate API calls to set env vars
3. Never include env vars in spec updates

**Pros**: 
- Complete separation of concerns
- Env vars never in Git

**Cons**: 
- Complex deployment process
- Not atomic

### Solution 4: Spec Templating with Merge
1. Maintain a template spec in Git (no secrets)
2. On deploy, fetch current spec
3. Merge template with current (preserving env vars)
4. Deploy merged spec

**Pros**: 
- Preserves existing env vars
- Template in Git has no secrets

**Cons**: 
- Complex merge logic needed
- Potential for merge conflicts

## Current State Assessment

### What We Have
- ✅ Environment variables set and working (after manual fix)
- ✅ Deployment workflow that attempts to preserve env vars
- ✅ Manual recovery script (`scripts/fix_env_vars.sh`)
- ❌ Automated deployment that preserves env vars

### What Happens on Deploy
1. GitHub Actions triggers on push to main
2. Workflow installs doctl and authenticates
3. Workflow fetches current spec from DO
4. **PROBLEM**: If last deploy cleared env vars, fetched spec is empty
5. Workflow updates image tag
6. Workflow deploys spec (with empty env vars)
7. All env vars except the 4 in app.yaml are cleared

### The 4 Survivors
These env vars survive because they're in app.yaml with values:
- `FLASK_ENV`: "production"
- `FLASK_APP`: "app.py"
- `DATABASE_URL`: ${db.DATABASE_URL}
- `POSTGRES_URI`: ${db.DATABASE_URL}

## The Solution: What We Need to Do

### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

#### 1. Add Secrets to GitHub Repository (10 minutes)
Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

Add these secrets:
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `REDIS_URL` 
- `CELERY_BROKER_URL`
- `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`
- `OPENPHONE_API_KEY`
- `OPENPHONE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY`
- `OPENPHONE_PHONE_NUMBER`
- `OPENPHONE_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- All other env vars from .env file

#### 2. Update app.yaml with Placeholders (5 minutes)
```yaml
envs:
  - key: SECRET_KEY
    value: ${SECRET_KEY}
    type: SECRET
    scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
  - key: REDIS_URL
    value: ${REDIS_URL}
    type: SECRET
    scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
  # ... repeat for all secrets
```

#### 3. Replace Deployment Workflow (10 minutes)
Replace the entire deploy.yml with one using the official action:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to DigitalOcean
  uses: digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2
  env:
    SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY }}
    REDIS_URL: ${{ secrets.REDIS_URL }}
    # ... all other secrets
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    app_name: attackacrack-prod
```

#### 4. Test Deployment
1. First run manual fix script to restore current env vars
2. Commit and push the changes
3. Verify env vars persist after deployment

### Why This Will Work

1. **We're using the RIGHT action**: `app_action` has built-in substitution
2. **Proven pattern**: This is DigitalOcean's recommended approach
3. **No more circles**: Env vars in GitHub, substituted during deploy
4. **Security**: Values encrypted as SECRET type in DO

### Alternative If GitHub Secrets Approach Fails

If for some reason the official action doesn't work, we can:
1. Get the current working spec with all env vars
2. Mark sensitive ones as type: SECRET
3. Let DO encrypt them
4. Store the encrypted values in app.yaml (safe because encrypted)
5. Deploy with encrypted spec

## Lessons Learned

1. **DigitalOcean's Design Philosophy**: The spec is meant to be complete and self-contained. Partial updates aren't the intended pattern.

2. **Environment Variable Types**: 
   - `GENERAL`: Plain text, visible in logs
   - `SECRET`: Encrypted at rest, decrypted at runtime
   - Both need VALUES to work

3. **Deployment Methods Matter**: 
   - `doctl apps update --spec`: Replaces entire spec
   - Official GitHub Action: Supports templating and substitution
   - Dashboard updates: Preserve existing config

4. **Secret Management Hierarchy**:
   - GitHub Secrets: For CI/CD only
   - DO App-Level Env Vars: Set via dashboard/API
   - Encrypted Spec Values: Safe in Git, app-specific

5. **The Fetch-Modify-Deploy Pattern**: Fragile when previous deployments fail

## Why We Failed Before and Why It Will Work Now

### What We Tried Before (Failed)
```yaml
# We used action-doctl (just installs CLI)
- uses: digitalocean/action-doctl@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

# Then manually ran doctl commands
- run: doctl apps update $APP_ID --spec .do/app.yaml

# app.yaml had placeholders
envs:
  - key: SECRET_KEY
    value: ${SECRET_KEY}  # This stayed as literal "${SECRET_KEY}"
```

### What Will Work Now
```yaml
# Use the ACTUAL deployment action
- uses: digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2
  env:
    SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY }}  # Pass the actual values
    REDIS_URL: ${{ secrets.REDIS_URL }}
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    app_name: attackacrack-prod

# The action will:
# 1. Read app.yaml with ${SECRET_KEY} placeholders
# 2. Substitute with values from env
# 3. Deploy the substituted spec
```

### The Critical Difference

1. **action-doctl**: Just installs the CLI tool, no magic
2. **app_action/deploy**: Has built-in substitution engine that processes `${VAR}` placeholders

We were so close! We had the right syntax (`${SECRET_KEY}`) but the wrong tool to process it.

## Conclusion

After weeks of attempts, we've learned that:
1. We were using the wrong GitHub Action initially (`action-doctl` vs `app_action`)
2. Even the official `digitalocean/app_action` doesn't work as documented
3. The `${VARIABLE}` substitution feature appears to be broken or undocumented
4. Plain `doctl` commands don't do any substitution
5. DigitalOcean App Platform has strong opinions but unclear documentation

### August 16, 2025, 2:30 PM - THE BREAKTHROUGH! 🎉

**Discovery**: When we run the manual fix script, DigitalOcean automatically:
1. Encrypts all the sensitive values
2. Marks them as `type: SECRET`
3. Returns encrypted values like `EV[1:xyz:abc...]`
4. These encrypted values are SAFE to store in Git!

**The Solution**: 
1. Run manual fix script to set all env vars
2. Export the spec with `doctl apps spec get`
3. Save the spec with encrypted values to app.yaml
4. Commit the encrypted values (they're safe!)
5. Deploy normally with simple `doctl apps update`

**Current State (August 16, 2025, 2:30 PM)**:
- All environment variables are now encrypted in app.yaml
- Encrypted values are safe to commit to Git
- Simple deployment workflow restored
- THE SAGA MIGHT FINALLY BE OVER!

Our current approach of using the manual fix script works but is not sustainable.

## THE FINAL SOLUTION

### Encrypted Values in app.yaml (August 16, 2025)

After weeks of struggle, we discovered the simplest solution was right in front of us:

1. **Set environment variables once** (via manual script or DO dashboard)
2. **Export the spec** - DigitalOcean automatically encrypts sensitive values
3. **Commit the encrypted spec** - Values like `EV[1:key:encrypted]` are safe
4. **Deploy normally** - Encrypted values work across all deployments

### Why This Works

- **Encrypted values are app-specific**: Can't be used with other apps
- **Safe to commit**: The `EV[1:...]` format is designed for version control
- **No substitution needed**: DigitalOcean decrypts at runtime
- **Simple deployment**: Just `doctl apps update --spec app.yaml`

### Implementation

```yaml
# In app.yaml - these encrypted values are SAFE to commit
envs:
  - key: SECRET_KEY
    type: SECRET
    value: EV[1:xyz:encrypted_value_here]  # Safe!
    scope: RUN_AND_BUILD_TIME
```

### The Journey's End

What started as a complex problem with GitHub Actions, substitution, and circular dependencies ended with the simple realization that DigitalOcean's encrypted values feature was the solution all along. We just needed to:
1. Set the values once
2. Export the encrypted spec
3. Commit it safely
4. Deploy with confidence

The environment variables saga is finally over. 🎉

## Known Issues

### Valkey Not Shown as Attached Resource (August 16, 2025)

**Issue**: Valkey (Redis) database `db-valkey-nyc3-14182` doesn't appear as an attached resource in the DigitalOcean App Platform UI or spec, despite being fully functional.

**Status**: ✅ **Confirmed Working** - This is a UI/spec display issue only

**Verification**:
- Valkey database exists and is online: `doctl databases list` shows it
- Connection URI matches app configuration: `rediss://default:***@db-valkey-nyc3-14182-do-user-24328167-0.f.db.ondigitalocean.com:25061`
- Web service connects successfully (logs show Redis URL)
- Health checks pass (200 OK)
- Session management working (Flask-Session uses Redis)
- Background tasks processing (Celery uses Valkey as broker)

**Why This Happens**: 
DigitalOcean App Platform only shows databases in the `databases:` section of the spec as "attached resources". Valkey/Redis connections are made via environment variables (REDIS_URL, CELERY_BROKER_URL) rather than being formally attached like PostgreSQL databases. This is the standard pattern for Redis/Valkey with App Platform.

**No Action Required**: The connection is working correctly. This is cosmetic only.

### Previously Undocumented Discoveries
1. **Component-Level Update Attempt**: We tried to create a script using `doctl apps update-component` which doesn't exist
2. **Multiple sed Attempts**: Despite initial denials, we DID try sed substitution (for image tags in commit `9f41b83`)
3. **Flask-Session Issue**: Environment variable problems were compounded by Flask-Session failing with multiple workers (only 1 in 4 requests authenticated)
4. **Test Files Created**: During debugging, test specs were created (`/tmp/test-spec.yaml`, `/tmp/test-spec-encrypted.yaml`) to understand encryption

### The Evolution of Understanding
1. **Phase 1**: Thought it was a security issue (don't commit secrets)
2. **Phase 2**: Thought it was a substitution issue (wrong GitHub Action)
3. **Phase 3**: Thought it was a state management issue (fetch-modify-deploy)
4. **Phase 4**: Realized DigitalOcean's design philosophy (spec is complete truth)
5. **Phase 5**: Discovered encrypted values were the intended solution all along

### Why Each Approach Failed (Root Causes)
1. **Plain text secrets**: Security vulnerability
2. **Empty SECRET types**: No values to encrypt
3. **Component updates**: Command doesn't exist
4. **action-doctl with placeholders**: No substitution engine
5. **Remove encryption**: Empty values = clear directive
6. **Native DO management**: Spec overrides dashboard
7. **Manual fix script**: Not CI/CD compatible
8. **Fetch-modify-deploy**: Circular dependency
9. **Official app_action**: Substitution feature broken/undocumented
10. **Encrypted values**: ✅ WORKED - This was the way

### Final Insights
- **DigitalOcean's Philosophy**: The spec file is meant to be complete and self-contained
- **Encrypted Values Purpose**: `EV[1:...]` format was designed specifically for version control
- **Documentation Gap**: DigitalOcean's documentation didn't clearly explain encrypted values were the solution
- **GitHub Actions Confusion**: Two similarly named actions (`action-doctl` vs `app_action`) caused significant confusion
- **The Simplicity Paradox**: The final solution was the simplest - just use what DO generates
