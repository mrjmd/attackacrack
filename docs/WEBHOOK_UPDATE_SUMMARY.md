# Webhook Integration Update Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Added `call.recording.completed` Webhook Support ‚úÖ
- **Event Type**: `call.recording.completed`
- **Purpose**: Fired when a call recording is ready (separate from call completion)
- **Payload Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "call.recording.completed",
    "data": {
      "object": {
        "id": "REC123456789",
        "callId": "CALL123456789",
        "url": "https://api.openphone.com/v1/call-recordings/CALL123456789",
        "duration": 300,
        "size": 2400000
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Key Features Added

- Message webhooks now capture the `media` array
- Media URLs are stored in `activity.media_urls`
- UI already displays media attachments beautifully

#### Call Recording Handling üéôÔ∏è

- `call.recording.completed` updates call when recording is ready later
- Handles async recording processing gracefully

#### AI Content Integration ü§ñ
- Call summaries attached to existing calls
- Full transcripts with speaker identification
- Sentiment analysis and next steps

### 4. Testing & Documentation

#### Test Suite (`test_webhook_handler.py`)
```bash
# Test all webhooks
python test_webhook_handler.py all

# Test media handling
python test_webhook_handler.py media

# Test AI content
python test_webhook_handler.py ai

# Full test suite
python test_webhook_handler.py full
```

#### Webhook Management (`manage_webhooks.py`)
```bash
# List current webhooks
python manage_webhooks.py list

# Create all webhooks (including call.recording.completed)
python manage_webhooks.py create

# Test connectivity
python manage_webhooks.py test

# Delete all webhooks
python manage_webhooks.py delete
```

### 5. Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean Separation** - Each webhook type has a dedicated handler
2. **Media Ready** - Full support for image/file attachments
3. **Idempotent** - Safe to process same webhook multiple times
4. **Well Tested** - Comprehensive test coverage for all events
5. **Production Ready** - HMAC signature verification, error handling

## Next Steps

1. **Clean Up Old Code**
   ```bash
   rm services/webhook_sync_service.py
   # Remove any webhook code from message_service.py
   ```

2. **Deploy Webhooks**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export OPENPHONE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY="your-key"
   export WEBHOOK_BASE_URL="https://your-domain.com"
   
   # Create webhooks
   python manage_webhooks.py create
   ```

3. **Monitor in Production**
   - Watch for media attachments in messages
   - Verify call recordings update correctly
   - Check AI summaries/transcripts populate

## Exciting Discovery: Media Attachments! üéâ

The OpenPhone `message.received` webhook includes a `media` array with URLs for all attachments. This means:
- Images sent via SMS/MMS are captured
- PDFs and other documents are included
- Multiple attachments per message supported
- URLs can be displayed directly in the UI

This was not documented in their API spec but IS available in webhooks!
